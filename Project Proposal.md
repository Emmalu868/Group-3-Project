# Project Description and Hypothesis
As per studies and research, gasoline prices and airline stock prices share an inverse relationship, with the value of airline stocks rising as the gasoline's price falls. Our project is to test this by analysing historic gasoline prices and airline stocks for some of the major economies and examining their relationship. Our project also analyses how the demand and price for gasoline is impacted by a global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
