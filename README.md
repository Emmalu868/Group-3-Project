## About the project
Analysis of trend in gasoline prices across geographical regions and examining the relationship between gasoline price and stock market.<br>


## Hypothesis
How does change in gasoline price affect stock market? <br>


## Datasets
* **[internationalpumppricesall.csv](https://github.com/Emmalu868/Group-3-Project/blob/main/Resources/internationalpumppricesall.csv):** Obtained from [data.ontario.ca](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/gasoline-report-international-gasoline-prices) and contains monthly average gasoline price from 2012 to 2022 for 6 major countries- UK, Germany, France, Japan, Canada and USA, all converted to Canadian cents per litre.  <br>
* **[coordinates.csv](https://github.com/Emmalu868/Group-3-Project/blob/main/Resources/coordinates.csv):** Contains geographic coordinates.

## Data Cleanup & Exploration
### Part 1: Analysis of Historical Gasoline Price
#### Files used for analysis 
[internationalpumppricesall.csv](https://github.com/Emmalu868/Group-3-Project/blob/main/Resources/internationalpumppricesall.csv)<br>
[coordinates.csv](https://github.com/Emmalu868/Group-3-Project/blob/main/Resources/coordinates.csv)<br>

* Used Pandas `read_csv` function to read the internationalpumppricesall csv file as a DataFrame and converted the dates to a DateTimeIndex. The internationalpumppricesall.csv file contains monthly oil price data from 2012 to 2022 for 6 major countries- UK, Germany, France, Japan, Canada and USA. 
* Detected and removed null values using `dropna` function.
* Removed a duplicate column "Situation fiscale" using `drop` function.
* Renamed columns to reflect the countries in English.
* Created a dataframe that slices the Tax Status for Total price.
* Used the hvplot function to plot the total_pump_price_all dataFrame as a line chart.

* Created a new dataframe and aggregated the values to include only the average price for each country.
